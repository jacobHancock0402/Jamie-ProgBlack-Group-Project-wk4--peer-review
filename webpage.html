    <***REMOVED***>Cerebral Cursor Control</***REMOVED***>
    <p>electrical activity from a few neurons monitored by the array electrodes was decoded into a signal to direct cursor movement. This enabled an individual to position a cursor on a computer screen, using neural signals for control combined with visual feedback</p>

        <***REMOVED***>Electroencephalography</***REMOVED***>
        <p>The most studied brain–computer interface to date is that involving electroencephalography (EEG).EEG is also a portable procedure, involving electrodes which are merely stuck onto the outside of a person’s head and can be set up in a lab with relatively little training, little background knowledge and taking little time — it can be done then and there, on the spot..interesting results have been achieved using EEG for the identification of intended finger taps, whether the taps occurred or not, with high accuracy. This is useful as a fast interface method as well as a possible prosthetic method </p>

        <***REMOVED***>Robotic Arm Controlled by Brain</***REMOVED***>
        <p>After enrolling to be involved in the research, Erik Sorto underwent surgery in 2013, during which he had a pair of small electrode arrays implanted in two parts of the PPC – one that controls reach and another that controls grasp.

            Each four-by-four-millimetre array contains 96 electrodes, each recording the activity of single neurons. The arrays are connected by a cable to a system of computer processors that decode the brain’s intent and turn this into movements of the robotic arm.
            
            After recovering from surgery, Sorto tested his ability to control the arm in the laboratory, something he described as surprisingly easy.</p>

        <***REMOVED***>Wheelchair Control</***REMOVED***>
        <p>The measurement of human brain signals and converting them into control signals require the development of an interface between the brain and the computer. A brain-computer interface (BCI) system provides communication between computer and mind of pupils. This interface can be based on brain activity during muscular movements or the changes of the rhythms of brain signals  These brain activities can be detected using electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. BCI transforms the EEG signals produced by brain activity into control signals which can be later used for controlling the wheelchair without using any physical controls. </p>
