#REVIEW OF Jamie-ProgBlack-Group-Project-wk4 by Practical Group 3 (JBourton Repository)

| Catagory      |  Rating |  Review |
| ----------- | ----------- | --- | 
| Interest of Content  | **Sound - 47** | Content for the medical section was interesting, but the other 2 written pages left much to be desired due to their lack of content. Furthermore, the 4th page doesn't even exist in terms of content. The Chosen topics are quite unrelated, but majority of credit goes to the medical section  |
| Consistency and quality of visual presentation | **Acceptable - 43** | Each page has a very different style, although at least the navbar has some consistency in terms of maintaining a constant feature across pages. The visual presentation is also very different in terms of pages that use images/don't use images. The AI and Climate Change page is particularly out of place, using a very different style to the other pages |
| Quality of written presentation | **Very good - 63** | Of what is written, the quality is very good. There are very few spelling mistakes, with only a few exceptions (such as 'intelligence'). Paragraphs mostly follow on from one another well. Mark is brought down a bit by lack of 4th page (no written presentation) and slide on AI/Climate change.|
