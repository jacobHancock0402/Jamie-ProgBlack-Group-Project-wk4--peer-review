#REVIEW OF Jamie-ProgBlack-Group-Project-wk4 by Practical Group 3 (JBourton Repository)

| Catagory      |  Rating |  Review |
| ----------- | ----------- | --- | 
| Interest of Content  | **Sound - 47** | Content for the medical section was interesting, but the other 2 written pages left much to be desired due to their lack of content. Furthermore, the 4th page doesn't even exist in terms of content. The Chosen topics are quite unrelated, but majority of credit goes to the medical section  |
| Consistency and quality of visual presentation   | **Weak** | Each page has a very different style, with the navbar being the only real consistent  |
| Validity of HTML | **Perfect** to **Acceptable** | Index.html has very few errors and is overall excellent while groupwork.html contains 11 errors.  Medical has few errors and is therefore **Very Good**.  Conservation.html is **perfect** and has no errors at all. |
| Evidence of collaboration | **Good** | There is evidence of both users making commits, however JamieSuchodolski makes more commits than DanielTM101. |
